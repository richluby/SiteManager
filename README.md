# SiteManager
Manages albums and accounts to generate an HTML styled album viewer

SiteManager is an application designed to allow users to manage a photo based website. It relies strictly on HTML and CSS in order to minimize any attack vectors due to server side scripting. The program allows users to manage albums of images; these images are then converted to a website view the HTMLGenerator class.
